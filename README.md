# Call of Dutty API (call-of-dutty-api)

The Call of Dutty API provides routes to access general information about the multiplayer modes in the Call of Dutty game series. The application is focused on a robust implementation of the Clean Architecture. You can explore and interact with the API through the available routes and also view the documentation on Swagger UI accessible via `/api-docs`.

## Installation

Make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine before proceeding.
