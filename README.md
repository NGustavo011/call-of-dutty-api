# Call of Duty API (call-of-duty-api)

The Call of Duty API provides routes to access general information about the multiplayer modes in the Call of Duty game series. You can explore and interact with the API through the available routes and also view the documentation on Swagger UI accessible via `/api-docs`.

## Installation

Make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine before proceeding.

Clone this repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/NGustavo011/call-of-dutty-api.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```sh
cd call-of-duty-api
```

Install the dependencies using npm:

```sh
npm install
```

or using yarn:

```sh
yarn
```

After installing the dependencies, you can start the development server using the following command:

```sh
npm run dev
```

or using yarn:

```sh
yarn dev
```

This will start the server, and you can access the API locally. Access the Swagger documentation at http://localhost:PORT/api-docs in your browser, where PORT is the configured port for the server.
